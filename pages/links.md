      ***Update*** This special section was archived at the start of 2024. Read more about [changes made in 2024](2024-redesign).

      A novel coronavirus brought the world to its knees at the start of 2020. Three months in—as India, the US, Italy, the UK, Spain and nearly every other country on the planet went into a lockdown—it became clear that this event would define our generation in ways we never expected. Starting from the first day India was locked down, a set of daily notes were published as [the <abbr class="font-sans-sc">COVID-19</abbr> diaries](/COVID-19/) that would record the views of a handful of people, but primarily of the owner of this website, of life under quarantine and several thoughts on how India and the rest of the world were handling this crisis.

      Other articles have also been published on the SARS-Cov-2 virus: read about [the bright side](/coronavirus/) of humanity’s capacity for survival; the global [economic impact](/covid-future/) of <abbr>COVID-19</abbr>.

I eventually submitted it to the official Ulysses Styles & Themes collection where it was accepted and has since received a modest amount of love and installs.

      The lovely [Vaishnavi M. Kulkarni](https://instagram.com/mountain_i_am/) and I got married in December of 2018. This was our wedding website and since I coded it I gifted myself the right to unabashedly use my favourite typeface of all time, Minion, almost everywhere. (The wife approved.) While this website is not of public interest, it is certainly in my personal interest to archive the link here for posterity.

      The [currently live version](/wedding) has been edited so everything is in the past tense and our wedding day counter has been removed. However, there is [a frozen version of the site](/prewedding) that still looks exactly as it did before the wedding except with the countdown timer reading zero for obvious reasons.

Although not an accurate representation of the current state of things, my fundamental approach to technology has remained somewhat consistent since this interview to this day.

      <figure class="float right"><img src="/images/Political-compass-VHB.png"></figure>

      In 2016 I first sat the [political compass test](https://www.politicalcompass.org). Before then I had thought of myself as a  socially modern liberal but fiscally conservative person. After the test I was told I was staunchly in the middle of the third quadrant of the political compass. I expected to be further left and closer to the x-axis but the test refused to oblige. I sat the test a few more times over the next few years and the result remained the same. The last time I sat this test was in December of 2019. You can [see the latest graph](/images/Political-compass-VHB.png) which is quite representative of its predecessors. I am unsure about the accuracy of this test (although I have seen many people believe it is reasonably accurate, even academically) but it certainly is a fun activity to partake in.

    content: 'From 2011 to 2017 this website was powered by Wordpress. In 2017, to mark its ten year anniversary, there took place what I like to call the great purge: I removed over 500 essays permanently from the database to allow for a leaner collection of articles with an increased baseline quality for the entire archival. Since 2017 this website has eschewed databases and moved to Hugo (after a brief stint with Kirby) for a more modern framework on which to run the site; and articles made since that time, including a handful from the 2011–2017 years, can be found on this website. You are welcome to browse the archives anytime.'
