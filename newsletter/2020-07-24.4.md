Hello after a while.

The world is hastening back to normalcy. *Hastening*. Whether this haste will prove costly or not will be clear sooner than we realise—and we may not necessarily like how some things turn out.

Yet, all is not gloomy: among the many ways in which our society will change is the surprising return of some rather fun pastimes we have lost on the way, such as [drive-in cinema](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/08/03/the-return-of-the-drive-in?itm_source=parsely-api), which is already making a comeback in New York.

What else might return to surprise us pleasantly?

Shot over more than eight years and across forty trips to North Korea, this documentary, directed by Pierre–Olivier Francois, provides a unique glimpse into the typical life of a North Korean citizen with little focus on the outlandish stuff about the country we are all somewhat already familiar with.

## When teaching is a form of protest

The unrest of inequality is everywhere today, be it racial, cultural, gender-based or whatever else. Teachers find themselves in an especially powerful position to course correct in such times. Christopher Emdin a professor of Science Education at Columbia University suggests that starting a dialogue in a classroom and making it an ideal ‘society’ for students to grow up in can catalyse how, over time, society itself learns to better accept differences.

He asks us to see students as *co-teachers* and writes, ‘Co-teaching requires that teachers be humble enough to become students of their students ... [who] will benefit most from a teacher listening to their experiences’. If you are a teacher, consider implementing this idea in your classroom; or if you know a teacher, let them know about [this well-written piece](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2020/07/reality-pedagogy-teaching-form-protest/614554/).
