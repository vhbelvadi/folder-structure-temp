There are innumerable choices of platform and technology when it comes to building a one-off website today. However, when it comes to frequently updated, content-heavy websites, it is hard to go wrong with whatever platform or technology one chooses except that every choice comes with sacrifices. Choosing an approach is then an exercise in picking what one does not mind giving up in exchange for something their prioritise.

Back in 2017 when I moved this website out of Wordpress (ending a ten-year stint) and into Kirby 2, I had explained my motivations. At that point I still think it was the right decision. In short, Kirby offered two 'features' that addressed my complaints with Wordpress: it did away with databases and it used markdown-powered text files to handle content, leaving my files in my control and not locked in some propreitary format—or so I thought.

## Assessing needs

Around 2019 [I moved from Kirby to Hugo](/github-experience) because the migration from Kirby 2 to Kirby 3 proved to be a headache (or I just was not up to it). Hugo was different in a way that mattered as I would soon learn: it stored files as traditional yaml instead of Kirby's key–value pairs yaml. The former is used by all static site generators and new-generation solutions like 11ty and Astro as well. And in front of that it looked like Kirby's insistance of storing flat file data as key–value paired yaml is a propreitary approach in some way.

As my day job got in the way—perhaps I should as say reality grounded me—I found I had complaints about Hugo as well (at least the SSG aspect). I have no complaints about Hugo as a product and will still recommend it wholeheartedly to everyone (including Go language templating which so many seem to detest) except that the more my day job took up my time the more I realised the value of a nice GUI like Kirby's. Besides this, I had no reason whatsoever to leave Hugo behind.

There are GUI options for Hugo but none work as well as a native app might. Netlify CMS is dead; Forestry is moving to Tina; and I had a hard time getting smaller options like the built-in VS Code front end (see [Frontmatter](https://frontmatter.codes) for example) working properly. The last bit could be my impatience or inability to spare more time, but at the end of the day I needed a better packaged solution. After all, like they say, only a website owner cares about designing and building their site. Everyone else only cares about the content on offer. 

At this juncture I found myself in the market for web development technology that worked for me. I feel, however, as I make note of my thoughts here, that most people looking to build a content-driven site (such as this) will have similar requirements and benefit from this discussion. What I needed was the best of both worlds: a fast, flexible solution like Hugo—which keeps my files in truly standard formats like markdown and traditional yaml—and a great GUI like Kirby's that makes working with my site a breeze wherever I am (including on my mobile) without having to worry about committing via git all the time. This was my list of requirements:

* Technology evolves, so the content must be in a simple, universal, device-agnostic and non-propreitary format.
* Shortcodes are great but when you collect hundreds of articles with shortcodes, migration becomes a problem, so shortcodes do not factor into my decision.
* Plugin architecture is important but plugins for basic functionality should not be necessary (think rss/atom, search functionality etc.)
* Markdown is critical, with at least all standard commonmark syntaxes supported out of the box.
* Themeing in some form should be possible, with at least design files contained independently of the content.
* GUI is important for daily use even if development/web design is via the terminal.
* The backend should be accessible via a web browser so as to allow wide accessibility without much (or any) setup.
* Tailwind should work out of the box (this may not be something everyone likes but I enjoy it for certain use cases) or a simple integration should exist.

## Knockout round

Let us start with the solutions I dropped right off the bat—including brief reasons why I dropped some popular ones. I am comfortable with coding[^1] and prefer it to less flexible alternatives. I understand that some may find drag-and-drop and WYSIWYG builders more to their taste, so keep this in mind when judging my explanations.

**Squarespace** is an overpriced, fancy edition of Wix and **Ghost** is a somewhat better Wordpress. I sidestepped both these options for being too restrictive. (Ghost Pro is again overpriced.)

**Wordpress** was what I used for ten years after my first-ever platform, Vox[^2], and while I get how it can be the perfect combination of possibility and simplicity for nearly every level of user out there, it is not my cup of tea. The backend bloat and convoluted themeing and plugin maintenance make Wordpress a headache in the long run. Despite my complaints, Wordpress is a good choice if it works for you; a lot of big companies still use it seemingly without much issue.

**Craft** is my single favourite Wordpress alternative today. I use it for both my startups [Avidfolk](https://avidfolk.com) and [Physics Capsule](https://physicscapsule.com) and absolutely love it. Craft is stable, lightweight, uses a database and has no bloat that usually results from complexities arising out of backwards compatibility. Maintenance is also a breeze and—for its cost—the support is brilliant.

**Grav** and **Jekyll** are flat-file and static solutions respectively. I have briefly test driven both and dropped them simply because there exist better alternatives.

**Kirby** is a terriffic alternative to Grav. It is a flat-file CMS that is easy to deploy, maintain and use. With Kirby 3 there is a vue-supported frontend that I absolutely enjoyed using. There are some drawbacks with Kirby, though, for which I dropped it but because they form such an important part of my decision making we shall discuss them a short while later.

**Hugo** is a superior alternative to Jekyll (in my opinion) and was what powered this website from 2019 to early 2023. I do not have any complaints about Hugo except that it has no GUI. I did not need it in the initial days when I could dedicate time to maintain my website and had the luxury of only ever typing from the comfort of my study.

As soon as my day job prevented me from dedicating a lot of time to my Hugo site, the lack of a GUI that could have made my job easy became glaringly obvious. What I was looking for, then, was Hugo with a GUI (which did not materialise for reasons I have explained above).

**Astro** and **11ty** are new kids on the block. I absolutely enjoyed Astro but find the development slow for a website with several markdown files. I also do not need the benefits Astro brings to the table because my website is pretty light weight by nature in terms of javascript. As for 11ty I was simply not fully comfortable with its javascript-heavy approach. Granted, I probably need to spend time with both Astro and 11ty which is why I will neither be recommending them nor warning my readers against them.

## Dancing between Kirby, Hugo and Statamic

Hugo seems to have a problem with Tailwind CSS. And Kirby loves its non-standard syntax. I found that Statamic was in the Goldilocks zone for me.

Hugo requires [a lot of fussing around](https://rajasimon.io/blog/hugo-tailwind-css-jit/) to get Tailwind to work out of the box. Tailwind CLI does not do a straightforward job unless you choose to keep two terminal windows open and two watch commands running. And the npm-based approach also fails as Hugo's pipelines do not support that workflow (at least as of the time of writing this article). Finally, to make things work as they should, Hugo demands a hacky workaround that involves using PostCSS to update Tailwind and then call the CSS file into the DOM via a Hugo cached partial.

Kirby on the other hand works with Tailwind as expected but [has its own drawbacks](/github-experience). Specifically, Kirby uses non-standard syntaxes in the name of (ironically) flexibility. Front matter is not stored in traditional YAML files but as key–value pairs instead. Where every other website compiler treats the main content of a markdown file as the main content of its respective page, Kirby labels it as a key–value pair. This also breaks down the ‘standard’ YAML frontmatter format where all the frontmatter is stored within `---` separators. Instead, Kirby uses `----` to separate *each key–value pair*.

Sometimes the approach Kirby takes works. For example, footnote syntax in Kirby is simply `[^ Note]` as opposed to the commonmark standard of `[^Label]` and `[^Label]: Note`. (Hugo uses the commonmark standard despite using the GO Lang-based Goldmark markdown processor.) This means Kirby is considerably more straightforward but it also means my footnotes break if I ever decide to migrate away from Kirby. ‘How’, I found myself wondering, ‘is this any different from the Wordpress vendor lockdown I was complaining about in the first place?’ Kirby is like a a flat-file equivalent of the same old vendor lockdown.

In the middle of all this I realised I wanted the system of Kirby with the features and behaviour of Hugo. Statamic was the perfct combination of the two.

## Why Statamic

First, moving from Hugo to Kirby was tough. Moving my data was not easy and that meant not all my essays could be moved immediately to Kirby. While there do seem to be `Data::Read` and `Page::Create` methods to resolve this, just how I can use it is not clear. (Creating a php file with these commands throws errors; I gave up after nearly a whole day of trying.)

In Statamic, though, I just uploaded the same hugo files via FTP and... that was it. Things worked out exactly as I had expected. Statamic uses the standard yaml format and not a key-value pair format like Kirby. I really enjoyed everything about Kirby but this was a dealbreaker through and through. Kirby is lightweight—much lighter than Statamic—and implementation is more straightforward, with Tailwind CLI for example. However, Statamic comes with Tailwind 2 support built in, which is even better because no set up is needed. A simple `npm run watch` will autoupdate the Laravel Valet local domain and `npm run production` runs Tailwind through a production-ready pipeline.

Hugo pipelines are better than Statamic but since I run my site through Cloudflare which takes care of minification etc., the overall result is comparable between Statamic and Hugo despite the former not being a static site. Like Kirby, I also have search built into Statamic which I lose out on with Hugo.

The Statamic editor is superior to Kirby in a lot of ways. For instance, we have a full-screen mode, syntax highlighting for markdown, and incredibly straightforward live preview. Statamic requires almost no set-up on my part to get it working how I want it to work. To me this is a big advantage. Additionally, like Craft CMS, Statamic has a great blueprint builder that keeps me out of yaml files. As with Hugo, Kirby needed me to fiddle with yaml files for every little tweak of the blueprint. But with Statamic, I have a great front-end builder that makes tweaking me blueprints a piece of cake.

Statamic also supports CommonMark out of the box. While its Bard field type and Replicator (like Craft CMS's Matrix field type) are great[^3], they end up introducing some level of vendor lock-in. However, since the simple old markdown field type always exists that simply extracts the yaml content, the Bard and Replicator fields are entirely optional and I do not use them for my essays and book reviews. I do use them for my single pages e.g. the [Covid diaries](/covid-19) or the [Links](/links) pages as these are few in number and copy–pasting their content elsewhere later would not be a big issue, unlike moving hundreds of essays or book reviews. They also help me avoid the subpage set-up I had previously with Hugo and Kirby.

Finally, Antlers is a breeze. This is, for example, the snippet of code was used to render the masthead atop this page while on Hugo:

```
<div>
	<div>
    {{ if isset .Params "images" }}
      <div>
        <img src="{{ index (.Params.Images) 0 }}" class="min-w-full">
      </div>
    	<div class="inline-block text-faded mb-2">
                {{ $taxonomy := "tags" }}
                {{ with .Param $taxonomy }}
                    {{ range $index, $tag := . }}
                      {{- if gt $index 0 }} / {{ end -}}
                      {{ with $.Site.GetPage (printf "/%s/%s" $taxonomy $tag) -}}
                          <span><a href="{{ .Permalink }}">{{ $tag | markdownify }}</a></span>
                      {{- end -}}
                    {{- end -}}
                {{ end }}
                —
        </div>
  </div>
</div>
    {{ $title := .Params.title }}
    {{ if isset .Params "fulltitle" }}
      {{ $title = .Params.fulltitle }}
    {{ end }}
    <h1>
      {{ $title | markdownify }}
    </h1>
    <h2>
      {{ .Params.Subtitle | markdownify }}
    </h2>
</div>
```

[^1]: I am not entirely confident of React, for example, although I would love to use some such interface-building solutions to make this website in the future.

[^2]: Not the current vox media company but the older Vox blogging platform.

[^3]: If Statamic were not handling the blueprint yaml by itself, the Bard and Replicator fields would be a nightmare rather than a USP for Statamic.
