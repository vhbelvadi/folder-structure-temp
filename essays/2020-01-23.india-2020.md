Earlier this week *The Economist* released its 2019 Democracy Index, the thirteenth revision since its first production in 2006. The index carried the ‘worst average global score’ ever and saw India slip in rankings moving, for the first time ever, closer to the rank of a hybrid democratic/authoritarian regime than to that of a full democracy.

Ups and downs are part of the growth of every country so even if one were to remain optimistic despite our steadily declining democratic ranking since 2014, it would be wise to outline our priorities. If there is a collection of areas of development on which we ought to focus, the following ten would arguably be the most important of the lot.

<figure class="fullwidth"><img src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/671/85/sites/default/files/images/articles/20200125_wom933.png"><figcaption><a href="https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2020/01/22/global-democracy-has-another-bad-year">The Economist</a>.</figure>

To understand the idea behind this choice of ten avenues for development it is important to understand our end goal. For India development has never been about becoming a superpower on someone else’s terms, rather we have been our own critics and sculptors.

A developed India is one where individual freedoms are guaranteed, secularism and privacy are held with the same high regard as a Hindu deity or an Islamic scripture, where bias in any form does not exist on the part of the state and is discouraged among private entities, where civic society is responsible and civic facilities are ample, where a certain minimum quality of life is assured, and, finally, where a proper balance exists between modernity and tradition: Gandhi once said, ‘It is good to swim in the waters of tradition but to sink in them is suicide.’

None of this is radical: some of the countries at the top of the Democracy Index have, in fact, achieved many of these and gone beyond at times. It is also not about following others’ footsteps blindly because like any society and any peoples the strategies we adopt and the measures we take towards achieving these goals have to be tailored to our society and peoples. That said, we can always seek inspiration and humbly learn from both the successes and the failures of others.

## 1. The safety and empowerment of women

### The problems

India’s tale with women is highly polarised. Over the last decade the country has passed several laws designed to uplift women. One law ensured 33% reservation in Parliament for fair representation during the legislative process while another framed rules to fight sexual harassment at workplaces; a high court famously ruled that a husband forcing his wife to wear specific clothing was grounds for divorce, and, most recently, the Supreme Court ruled that the Islamic *talaq-e-biddat* was unconstitutional. Despite this, the number of reported rapes is continuously rising, as are reports of domestic violence, abduction and violence in general.

On the one hand India had a female Prime Minister before Britain or France of the US (of which the latter two are yet to elect a female president) while on the other hand, in 2013, a crime was supposedly committed against a woman somewhere in India every three minutes.

The stark contrast seen here and in other stories like these tell us three things: first, it is not the system that holds back women in India, it is the people who are part of that system who are to blame; second, Indian society as a whole is not against women’s rights but several households seem to be oppressive; and third, the political classes in India enjoy using women’s rights and development as a talking point while in reality not enough actionable steps have been taken in favour of these issues.

### The solutions

This problem can only be tackled on a societal and individual level. No amount of legislation or exemplary punishments for offenders will replace steps taken to increase individual awareness and realisation.

South India and Northeast India top the country’s Female Safety Index. They are, in general, the safest places for women in the country, whether foreigners or locals. They also happen to be among the best educated parts of the country. If this correlation appears to be purely by chance consider that the top 20% of the safest countries for women are also among the top 20% of the best educated countries on earth. Clearly, education works (more on this later).

<div class="quote">Governments love to initiate programmes but their interest and efficiency falls off exponentially once the initiative has done the rounds in the news.</div>

Educating people to identify women’s individual freedoms everywhere, from the household to the workplace, is key. Government policies—such as the current one against female foeticide and for educating young girls—can force equality and improve opportunities for women across the board. The arts industries can push women forward by giving them centre stage wherever reasonable.

There is some risk of overstepping, though, which has often been the problem with women’s rights activists. Taking things too far, to the point of quarrel, for no reason, or blindly replacing male figures for the sake of bringing in a woman figurehead, whether on screens or in real life, seems like and often is an exhibition. Another problem is following through: governments love to initiate programmes but their interest and efficiency falls off exponentially once the initiative has done the rounds in the news. For example, the famous *Nirbhaya fund*, which was set up after the 2012 Delhi gang rape, [has seen only 10% use](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nearly-90-of-nirbhaya-fund-lying-unused-govt-data/articleshow/72421059.cms) across the country as of December 2019.

Grievance redressal is an important area where society’s faith in women’s safety and growth can be strengthened (again, more on this later). Rape in India, for example, is met with the disgust it deserves but when disgust turns into a mockery of the system, and when people show more faith in exemplary murder than in due process, civility and the fabric of society are torn apart. We will forever remain a country that shoots suspected rapists after the fact; we must work towards becoming a country that prevents rape altogether.

Change has to be forced upon society through strategic policies that hold governments, private organisations and, at times, individuals to reasonable account. Long-term change can only be brought in by better educating newer generations. We cannot hope to see dramatic, sustainable change in a year or two, but a society where women are genuinely treated better, not required to act like men to be noticed, and given enough space to celebrate their femininity is a dream realisable by 2030.

## 2. A better education system

### The problems

By ‘education system’ I refer to the fundamental primary, secondary and tertiary education everyone should receive: from kindergarten to ten years of school to, at least, a Bachelor’s degree or equivalent diploma. The education system in India is rotting and there is no better way to put it. It is not worth addressing the questionable attempts some have made to re-write [history](https://carnegieendowment.org/2019/11/16/bjp-has-been-effective-in-transmitting-its-version-of-indian-history-to-next-generation-of-learners-pub-80373) or [science](https://undark.org/2018/12/10/indian-scientists-confront-pseudoscience/) in textbooks or the plethora of [false claims ministers have made](https://caravanmagazine.in/science/false-scientific-claims-modi-first-term), most notably *during the Indian Science Congress*.

The entire education system should be set apart as an independent body in the country not unlike the judiciary, legislative and executive. The government should be legally bound to supporting it with funds and legally compelled to keep its head out of any decision making when it comes to education. Schools are no place for bias.

Moreover, India has an insufficient number of schools, let alone good ones. The few good schools that exist can only ever have minimal impact for no fault of their own; and the many brilliant teachers out there find there is little scope to work to the fullest extent of their capabilities. A bureaucratic system strangles higher education with academicians and administrators alike vying for position and prestige, and demanding respect rather than earning. Institutions that have somehow been deemed to be the best—largely because of word of mouth—are resting on their laurels. All this noise is drowning out people who are genuinely interested in their work and genuinely good at their job.

### The solutions

A thorough reshuffle alone can save the education system in India. The first step is to make *good* education affordable. Governments have long worked to help students, particularly those from remote and rural areas and poor families, enrol at schools for primary and secondary education. However, they have stopped there: once a child is enrolled at a school and goes through the process the government considers them ‘educated’. Little attention is paid to what actually goes on in school.

<div class="quote">The broken system we currently have was put in place by the formal examination system. Looking to more examinations to correct this error would be foolish.</div>

Public schools, as in schools funded by public money and managed by the government, should ideally be handed off to an independent body only partly regulated by the government and with unfettered rights to lay out a roadmap for schools as they see fit. Public schools should become examples for private schools in the quality of education they provide while private schools will doubtless continue to remain examples in terms of the facilities they offer. Both schools can offer similar educational experiences at least as far as what is necessary goes while some schools can go above and beyond by offsetting costs by charging parents more. After all public schools have always been cheaper than private schools; this, however, need not be reflected in the quality of education provided.

Recruitments for higher education should be done in the first place, and it should be done in a more reliable manner. The broken system we currently have was put in place by the formal examination system. Looking to more examinations to correct this error would be foolish. A merit- and capability-based personal interview checked for bias and favouritism by multiple people will ensure that universities and colleges can handpick the most deserving applicants to shape their institution rather than be delivered a set of recruits blindly.

Verification by an independent governing body, possibly by independent watchdogs, and multiple personnel within an institution or group of institutions in a region (all while making room for applicants to voice their complaints) can more than eradicate potential biases or misuse of the system.

By increasing the number of schools overcrowding can be prevented. More teachers too can be employed, so long as it is done without sacrificing quality, giving the system as a whole a much better opportunity to shape a generation. Continuous, career-long teacher training is another area that has not been given the emphasis it deserves and, with exchange programmes and speakers who have something of substance to discuss, this is a low-cost, high-yield investment for the education system.

A more dynamic curriculum should be implemented: dynamic both in character and in the ease of changing things around. Currently changes in curriculum require such great managerial and schedule co-ordination skills that most institutions would rather stick to a curriculum for the entire five-year period they are allowed to rather than make meaningful changes year-on-year. Teachers and, to some extent, parents (in case of primary and secondary schools) should be given a substantial voice in shaping the curriculum even if it will be the higher-ups who take the final call.

Finally, the obsession India has with bridging industry and academia has to end. This often sounds like fashionable seminar talk for those who have nothing to say. Academia never has and never should be merely a training ground for industries. It is where minds evolve, where people learn to learn, where people grow as individuals, where people learn to adapt and acquire knowledge, where people learn how to think, where people learn who they are and where their interests lie, where people explore themselves without judgement, and where people learn skills that either interest them or that they stumble upon and realise they are good at.

It is up to industry to take well-formed minds and provide them specific training knowing they have guaranteed returns in the form of mentally capable, high-performing, responsible employees. Industries should headhunt candidates with specific fundamental skillsets upon which they can build, not expect academia to be a breeding ground for their fully-formed minions.
