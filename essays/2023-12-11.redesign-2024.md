The love for design ironically breeds a sense of eternal dissatisfaction with design itself. Liking designing means not liking any design long enough to keep it. This can be a good thing, sprouting continual improvements. But it also means not having any design long enough to nurture it, and that can quickly become concerning.

The year 2023 was a tumltuous one for this website, almost reflecting the tumultuous year I had myself—moving towns and countries and jobs. This website, in 2023, saw far too many changes; most were good, some were perhaps questionable, but what was certain amidst all the uncertainty was that 2023 was a transitory phase for this website.

This year also marked this website’s sweet sixteenth, and unintentionally also the the sort of identity crisis teenagers might face. Ultimately, this can turn out to be a clarifying experience, and to me at least that was what it was. And that was what brought out the current (and final) 2024 design. More important, it clarified to me the _whys_ of my design choices.


## The whys of design

More often than not, good design comes from a clarification of _why_ a design is the way it is. A large blame for the tumult in 2023 was that the _why_ was missing from my design choices. There were elements that made sense from a design-perspective in that I knew _that_ something had to be a certain way but nor _why_. This 2024 re-design is not only more than a re-paint but also addresses the _whys_ of my design choices.

Simplicity to me has been central to design itself. I adore simplicity in all its complex forms. I viewed simplicity too often as reduction of artistic excess, and with this outlook came the false dichotomy that sans-serifs, being simple, embodied simplicity and serifs, being ornamental, did the opposite. It was _either_ serif _or_ simplicity. 

Clarifying the idea of simplicity meant separating typographic structure from the overall website design (although I did have an epiphany regarding my choice of type—[see below](#marker)). It also meant extending this simplicity to other areas of the website and in other ways. I will refrain from listing any examples of simplicity here because, as you will see over the rest of this article, simplicity underlies nearly every decision.

## Tough decisions

One form of simplicity is in fact still reduction but of a different sort. It can also be seen as rationing focus between fewer areas on this website. I have therefore archived the old Covid diaries section. I think we have, as a society, outgrown the pandemic and the historiographic value of this section alone does not justify its continued maintenance. However, for anyone interested, the contents of this section can be shared privately.

<div class="aside"><strong>What are the Covid diaries?</strong> During the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020, my country went into lockdown like nearly every other country on the planet. These diaries record thoughts and reflections on ongoing events—mostly from myself but some from others I know—during the pandemic as only people living through those sudden, exceptional months could have done. The diaries were maintained on this website until roughly the end of 2023 and then archived.</div>

The other section being dropped is Music. This was a considerably tougher decision but I feel like it will work out in the end. I love making music and my music continues to be available across all major streaming platforms worldwide. I have been relatively quiet, having not composed over the last few years, but this may change down the line. However, since my music _does_ have a home elsewhere, I will not be maintaining it here separately.

This also ties into an idea I have long wanted to explore of separating my many ‘identities’—writer, photographer, musician, filmmaker etc.—and where I wanted my musician self to be completely separate. In fact when I first released my music I did so under a pseudonym. I might even bring it back at some point, but that deicsion is for another day. Along these lines, since my short films do not have any other place where they are categorised—although some are on IMDb—they will continue to enjoy a place on this website.

## Limiting decision fatigue

If the Covid diaries and Music sections are being dropped, what gains focus in their stead? There will be the four primary ‘active’ areas on this website going forward: essays, book reviews, photography and newsletter. These will not only receive updates of varying frequency but they will also (with the exception of Photography) be searchable.

My motivation for this is four-fold: first, I love writing and hope to force myself into a proper schedule for this through [my newsletter](/newsletter); second, I love writing and want to be more purposeful with it [through my essays](/essays) (more on this later); third, I want to further build my reading habit—I have no complaints because I _did_ get more reading done this year than in any of the last five—and make the [reading list](/reading-list) and [book reviews](/bookshelf) on this website my sole catalogue of this habit; fourth, I love photography and want to better catalogue my work, which is not something I have done well in the recent past.

I have also removed any links to my Twitter profile because I am no longer active on Twitter. I do have an account and I still use the app to follow others but no longer tweet. My social networking activity takes place wholly in Mastodon, [a platform in which I have great faith](/mastodon) and whose fundamental beliefs [I have long shared](/the-perfect-social-network).

This trimming extends to this website’s internal navigation as well. To reduce decision fatigue for readers I have limited menu sections to a maximum of four options. This is motivated by the fact that I have four non-negotiable ‘active’ sections. Other sections on the menu follow suit.

The new menu sections are as follows: Works (containing essays, book reviews, photography and short films), Collections (containing the newsletter, links and reading list), Social (to e-mail, Mastodon, Instagram and Github), Imprint (colophon, privacy policy and the IndieWeb manifesto).

## Principles

The menu itself now gets out of the way while scrolling and re-appears when you attempt to scroll back up—a user interaction generally prompted by one’s intention to return to the top of a webpage to re-access the website menu. This also adds to a simplicity in the UI, paving the way for a cleaner experience.

This is just one of several design decisions intended to concretise and strengthen this website’s presence. Once again, simplicity underlies them all.

<img src="/assets/images/on-obligations.jpg" alt="Cover of the Oxford World Classics edition of Cicero’s book ‘On obligations’" class="float right">

Among the many items that made up the mood board prior to this re-design, and my primary source of inspiration for it, is a book whose design I have long admired: the Oxford World Classics edition of Cicero’s _On obligations_ (pictured). This book is typeset in Capitolium 2 on the cover and Ehrhardt inside. Both of these are excellent typefaces but neither are in use on this website. Design on physical paper does not always translate equally well onto screens. Instead, I looked for a typeface which draws a similar emotional response from the reader in terms of flow and solidity. Similar in tonality but better suited for screens, one that embraces traditional roots and modern cuts alike, and helps me do away with my serif/sans-serif dilemma. I found the solution in Grilli Type’s **<span class="text-accent">GT Sectra</span>**—in which the words you are now reading are set. (This is paired with **<span class="font-sans text-[85%] text-accent">GT America</span>**, also from Grilli Type.) You can always [read more in the colophon](/colophon#typefaces) so I will move on after publicly posing a challenge to myself: _I must ensure that this design, including colour, type, layout etc.—apart from minor fixes—must remain on this website for over a year._ Let us see how I fare.

The design also extends to the simpler line art that adorns essays resembling bookplates. On wider screens you should see this on your left, and on mobile phones you should see this at the top of the page. This means I create line art that in some capacity stands for the contents of the essay it goes with, offering readers some additional food for thought.

Yet another area in which this design extends is the titling. I opted to go bolder with the accent colour—not red like before; something similar but more stately— and use just that to make text stand out. First, this prevents overly large texts that could end up looking awkward, especially when multiple titling exists on a screen. Second, it allows for liberal use of negative space which further sets up the hierarchy without excessively large letters. Third, it gives a more sobre look to the entire website which I like.

<div class="gallery">
<img src="/assets/images/design-stage-1.jpg" class="border border-foreground-light">
<img src="/assets/images/design-stage-2.jpg"  class="border border-foreground-light">
<cite><strong>Left.</strong> The primary hierarcy allows for text in the accent colour but set at the same sizing as the body to be placed on the left, surrounded by lots of negative space. <strong>Right.</strong> The secondary hierarchy, such as on this page, allows for the exact same geometry—allowing for simplicity in code and design alike—without sacrificing clarity by any measure.</cite>
</div>

One final instance of both simplicity and decision fatigue—and reduced code redundancy for easier maintenance—comes in the form of article listing sections. Visit the essays page, bookshelf, newsletter, search for something, or take a look at [my recommended writings](/search?q=recommended) and you will see that they all look identical. This is by design. Not only does it simplify the code, it also prevents users from having to re-learn the UI on this website at various stage. It even ties things together with a sense of coherence.

Taking a leaf from book printing, I opted for the more tradition indented demarcation of paragraphs rather than the blank line spacing. I just happen to prefer this but I expect it to divide opinion.

## A new phase

This 2024 re-design is more than just a fresh coat of paint. If the idea was for me to make 360º improvements, they also had to include improvements in the content itself.

I have long fought the idea of crafting individual essays independently of the overall design of the site. Some writers do this and I think that it is a good idea on paper but practically, and as someone who writes more often, it demanded more time from me than I was willing to give.

However, there is something in this that I can no longer ignore. I have never sacrificed the quality of my writing so there is not much to add there. But where I _can_ make changes is in better proofreading, better general styling and some sense of bespoke presentation. So, starting with my next article, I will be proofreading better, following my personal style guide better, and using a custom single-line drawing representing the content of the essay thoughtfully. Overall then, this is a promise of better quality of everything you can find on this website.

<div id="marker"></div>

The other realisation I had in terms of design had to do with my indecision with typefaces. Some people have been especially kind in giving me their time in helping me pick a typeface but I never could stick to something. At first I blamed it on my designer-mindset where the possibility of re-designing something made things feel inadequate every time I saw them.

I came to realise that I was mistaking _what I liked_ about a typeface with _how I thought_. I admired (and still do) the cleanness and simplicity of a sans-serif and kept trying to bring it into my design. But why the alternating with serifs then? That was when I realised that, whether from habit or exposure, I just _thought better_ in serifs. That was why sans-serif typesetting felt _correct_ to me but my design sensibilities drew me to sans-serifs. A kept see-sawing between the two mindlessly. What I needed was a serif—in terms of which I could think and reflect my thought—that nevertheless possessed the cleanliness of sans-serifs.

A key part of this was also reducing the width of the text column that people would read. I used to stay around the 700px mark with 75–85 characters per line. The current design drops that to an upper limit of 600px with 65–75 characters. This might seem like a small difference, even one that is too small to matter, but really it only speaks to the nimbleness of the art of typesetting.

## Function and form

The new design also does away with various other tertiary design elements in favour of negative space. These include inconsistent branding for my newsletter, _Confluence_ (which is now in line with this website, nothing special), inconsistent images for essays (the new design retains these for older articles simply because it is tough to go back and change every single one of them) etc.

The new design also takes better advantage of screen dimensions and orientations, with better planned responsiveness for when you are reading on, say, your iPad horizontally versus vertically. This also extends, of course, to phones and 4K desktop workstation monitors. This is different from before when things would simply replicate themselves and fill widths (albeit up to limits).

This improvement coupled with design consistency will provide an experience of ‘ease’ for readers wherever and however they may choose to consume the content published on this website.

The code for this website was also re-written from scratch, reducing redundancies, slimming down the code, and consequently reducing page sizes. This makes for an even faster, even leaner, yet richly functional experience.

Two other introductions are worth noting: <abbr>IBM</abbr> Plex Mono has been replaced by Input Mono primarily for code snippets. One might not see this type as often but it does away with some quirks of Plex Mono and is, in my opinion, a superior typeface overall. 

```
This is what Input Mono looks like.
```

While a single weight is licensed through typekit for use on this website, I also use Input Mono privately in VS Code. <abbr>DJR</abbr>, the designer behind Input Mono, allows free private use of this typeface and I would certainly recommend it to anyone dabbling in code.

The second and final, but considerably more important, added functionality is the new toggle for dark and light schemes. You will find this up in the menu bar next to the search button. By default it shows the current state (automatic). Click it to reveal the three possible means of handling this website’s colour scheme—dark mode, light mode, auto mode. Pick one and this website will remember it for you next time using just `local storage` and no cookies. Change it around anytime.

Previously, I favoured the simpler, more straightforward approach of only using the current auto mode. In fact, there was no way around it. What this means is this website respected whatever <abbr>OS</abbr>-wide scheme you had picked. This reduces choices for the viewers and simplifies the <abbr>UI</abbr> but also forces the user to interact with at an <abbr>OS</abbr>-wide level for any changes they would want on this website alone.

Many people, I later found, prefer a dark scheme for their <abbr>OS</abbr> but a light scheme for reading long form text. Some prefer the reverse (which I never understood). Still others agree with my original approach of keeping things <abbr>OS</abbr>-related. This new functionality adheres to all preferences. Try it out now: pick your colour scheme, change your <abbr>OS</abbr> scheme, refresh this page etc. and you will see it works really well.

Keen readers may also notice a small quality-of-life improvement: the navigation bar is now more forgiving in how you need to interact with it. Menus opened stay put until you interact with them but if you interact anywhere else—click or scroll for example—and they get out of your way for good. This was made possible thanks to the completely re-written code base.

***

2024 promises to be a year of personal and professional growth, and I wanted this website to be not only something I was proud of but also something that made it easy for me to interact with more frequently, to update and share and curate and more.

As always, do let me know what you think of the new direction this website is taking. It is just different enough from the previous iterations to be an improvement in ways that matter without being completely unrecognisable. To me, when it comes to products, that is the perfect type of balanced change that enhances possibilities while remaining respectful of end users.
