Every new year like a ritual, for the past half-decade or so, I have been updating my Goodreads account for the annual reading challenge: *12 books for the 12 months in a year*. Despite being a Goodreads librarian this has long been my only interaction with the site—I do not even follow up and mark these books as ‘read’ either—because setting the goal has always been the only important takeaway for me. As of now I am on my twelfth book this year, so I am safely on track.

However, I decided recently that in 2021 I wanted to take this number higher—say to 15 books. It was a modest improvement upon my earlier goal, but I know it will be a worthwhile venture. These goals are not set in stone mainly because I prefer to make my experience of reading books meaningful and the number is simply an odometer I glance at every once in a while to make sure I am reading at all. But the real question had little to do with books: *what would I have to do to reach this new target come next year?*

What started as a simple exercise in reading more books quickly spiralled into a serious question about our lifestyles today.
