A tale of two people who never meet, but gain a lot and lose a lot through nothing more than an unassuming piece of paper. A curious tale exploring the connections we share as humans.

The cast and select crew of *Origami* was on national television for an interview about the short film. The interview is [available to watch online](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7N97hG8cPWwOEIxM3JROVlhSjg/view?usp=sharing&resourcekey=0-6SHZScdqLngtj9wEkbnd0A).
