There are two things you should know before you read this review: one, if you have read even one of Mr Harari's books you will be more than aware that he is perhaps the most consistently good writer in his genre today; two, if you have read a couple of Mr Harari's books (especially *Sapiens* and *Homo Deus*) feel free to skip this one entirely as it brings little new to the table that he has not already discussed before.

*Money* is a novelette that traces the history of our economy and the idea of money—or where coloured pieces of paper got their esteemed value from—in an engaging tone and with a fast pace. You will end up wishing your history classes at school were more along these lines. If Mr Harari’s other books intimidate you, try this one: it is bite-sized for the modern, attention-deficient audience while simultaneously being full of value.

The book

- For thousands of years, philosophers, thinkers and prophets have besmirched money and called it the root of all evil. Be that as it may, money is also the apogee of human tolerance. Money is more open-minded than language, state laws, cultural codes, religious beliefs and social habits. Money is the only trust system created by humans that can bridge almost any cultural gap, and that does not discriminate on the basis of religion, gender, race, age or sexual orientation. Thanks to money, even people who don’t know each other and don’t trust each other can nevertheless cooperate effectively.
- ...to understand modern economic history, you really need to understand just a single word. The word is growth. For better or worse, in sickness and in health, the modern economy has been growing like a hormone-soused teenager.
- Starting from the barter system the author explains how the modern economy was created. People could not could use goods without a means of production; without goods they could not barter or exchange something for something else; and because they could never make such an exchange, they could never build a means of production in the first place. This was a vicious circle. The author says, “Humankind was trapped in this predicament for thousands of years as a result economies remained forces. The way out of the trap was discovered only in the model, with the appearance of a new system based on trust in the future.“
