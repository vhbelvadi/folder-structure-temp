This book does not offer a set of instructions for taking notes. It is about why you should be taking notes at all and why, specifically, you should be taking notes using [the _zettelkasten_ method](/zettelkasten). It is about how you can get through university better—by writing better, understanding better and learning better. This book is also _not_ about how to take the titular ‘smart notes’. It is about developing a method and principle of learning—one that I wish I had come across sooner—which can make you a considerably better academic for life. Unassmuing as it seems, this book is layered and what you take away from it depends on how many layers you peel away.

It is worth remembering in such times that the zettelkasten of Luhmann was built using boxes and index cards. It is perhaps time we returned our focus to understanding what zettelkasten really is so that the digital implementation we make can be our own and actually make sense rather than seem like an esoteric exercise. Lastly, if you are not a German speaker, every time you feel lost, keep remiding yourself that zettelkasten simply means ‘slip box’—a literal box of slips.
